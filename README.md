#Module_1 Recap 
##-- Focused mainly on Docker & PostgreSQL. 
We first created a Docker network to be shared between the postgres_server, pg_admin, and other containers, working with them.<br>
Then, we ran PostgreSQL and pg_admin using Docker Compose.<br>
After that, we ingested our data with some transformations into our database on the PostgreSQL server, once using a Docker file with a Python script, and once using a Jupyter notebook.<br>
In the end, we executed some queries to refresh our SQL analytics skills.<br>
